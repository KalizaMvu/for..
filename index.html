                You know I’m not a good writer, but I had to lock in for this one.
                And you know we love a good story time (yes i said we).
            </p>

            <p class="story">
                It all started at Kiya’s Friendsgiving, November 29th.
                I was chillin there with Melat and Sumer, just waiting to eat.

                Sumer and I were really there for the banana pudding.
                First in line, ready to go. Then we tried it and

                Sumer loved it.
                I thought it was… okay.

                After a few bites, you came up pressing me about it.
                “Why’s your plate back there? Finish all of it.”

                I thought that was the funniest thing in the worlddd.
                Somehow that random banana pudding interrogation turned into our first real conversation.
                I didn’t think much of it, little did I know, you were plotting.

                You noticed I wasn’t really talking much in big groups.
                So you pulled me aside, got me in the car so we could actually talk, just us.

                Writing this now, I realize how you’ve always paid attention.
                Not just now, but since the first day.

                If I’m uncomfortable, you shift the space.
                If I’m quiet, you sit quietly with me.
                If I'm being crazy, you match my energy.
                If I’m not ready to talk, you don’t force it.

                You’ve learned my habits, my moods, my silences, and you’ve met me there every time.

                I might not love your banana pudding,
                but I love literally everything else about you.

                And that’s why we’re here today.

                So go ahead and scroll to the next part princess.
